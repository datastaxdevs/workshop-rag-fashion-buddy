<summary><b> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Can I run this workshop on my computer?</b></summary>
<hr>
<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine, If you do so, you will need the following
<ol>
<li><b>git</b> installed on your local system
<li><b>Python 3.8+</b> installed on your local system
</ol>
</p>
In this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>We can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.

## LAB1 - Environment Setup

### 1.1 - Create Astra Account

- Access [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com) and register with `Google` or `Github` account. It is free to use. There is free forever tiers of up to 25$ of consumption every month.

![](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/astra/astra-signin-github-0.png)

### 1.2 - Create Astra Database


> If you are creating a new account, you will be brought to the DB-creation form directly.

- Get to the databases dashboard (by clicking on Databases in the left-hand navigation bar, expanding it if necessary), and click the `[Create Database]` button on the right.

- **‚ÑπÔ∏è Fields Description**

| Field                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vector Database vs Serverless Database** | Choose `Vector Database` In june 2023, Cassandra introduced the support of vector search to enable Generative AI use cases.                                                                                                                   |
| **Database name**                          | It does not need to be unique, is not used to initialize a connection, and is only a label (keep it between 2 and 50 characters). It is recommended to have a database for each of your applications. The free tier is limited to 5 databases. |
| **Cloud Provider**                         | Choose whatever you like. Click a cloud provider logo, pick an Area in the list and finally pick a region. We recommend choosing a region that is closest to you to reduce latency. In free tier, there is very little difference.            |
| **Cloud Region**                           | Pick region close to you available for selected cloud provider and your plan.                                                                                                                                                                 |

If all fields are filled properly, clicking the "Create Database" button will start the process.

![](https://datastaxdevs.github.io/langchain4j/langchain4j-2.png)

It should take a couple of minutes for your database to become `Active`.

![](https://datastaxdevs.github.io/langchain4j/langchain4j-3.png)

### 1.3. Get your credentials

To connect to your database, you need the API Endpoint and a token. The api endpoint is available on the database screen, there is a little icon to copy the URL in your clipboard. (it should look like `https://<db-id>-<db-region>.apps.astra.datastax.com`).

![](https://datastaxdevs.github.io/langchain4j/langchain4j-4.png)

To get a token click the `[Generate Token]` button on the right. It will generate a token that you can copy to your clipboard.


### 1.4 - Create VertexAI account

https://console.cloud.google.com/


### 1.5 - VertexAI Studio

- Create a new project by clicking on the `Select a project` dropdown and then clicking on `New Project`

![](assets/vertex-01.png)

- Name your project and click on `Create`

- Enable all Api for Vertex AI (make sure to have your billing account or free credit setup_)

![](assets/vertex-05.png)

- You should agree with the condition

![](assets/vertex-06.png)

- And then you should be able to access the Vertex AI Studio

![](assets/vertex-07.png)

- Select `Try Gemini` 

![](assets/vertex-08.png)

- Here we can pick a multi-modal model to use for our application
